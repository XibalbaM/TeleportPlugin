# Teleport plugin
A simple plugin witch allows the admins to create warp points.<br>
The players can teleport to the warp points with the command `/tpl <warp name>`.<br>
The warps are saved in the file `locations.json` by default, but can also be saved in server memory. 
This can be chosen in the config file.<br>
To create a point, use `/tplc` and to delete on use `/tpld`
